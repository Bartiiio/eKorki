A private lesson listing application is a platform that connects students with independent instructors for one-on-one or small group lessons. The application allows instructors to create a profile, set their hourly rates, and list the subjects they teach. Students can browse available instructors, view their profiles, and book private lessons based on their individual needs. This type of application is useful for individuals seeking personalized learning experiences or looking to improve their skills in a specific area.

Website functions:
- User profiles: Students and teachers can create profiles with basic information such as their name, email address, and profile picture.
- Lesson browsing: Students can browse available lessons by subject or topic.
- Lesson management: Teachers can add, edit, and remove lessons, specifying the subject and other relevant details.
